                    <p>I haven't worked on the game in a couple weeks, and the moment I opened the project my whole body went, “Nope...” as my mind flooded with self-doubt. You know that feeling1 where feeling like you <em>should</em> do something, ends up adding extra pressure and makes you avoid it even more? Yeah. That.</p>

                    <p>Maybe I just feel shitty because a mistake I made on a midterm the other day has permeated through every single molecule of my existence. There was a question I knew how to solve, like, actually knew, and during the test my brain just turned off. So today I did not feel like I am meant to be some character in a video game that shreds apart monsters with cybernetic claws and teeth... I felt like a run-of-the-mill bunny.</p>

                    <p>Anyway! My plan for today was...</p>
                    <p>- Add a level loading system<br>
                    - Make a basic enemy with very simple AI<br>
                    - Maybe start working on a player health system</p>

                    <p>Hehe, so usually when I say "my", what I actually mean is "our"</p>

                    <p>I think what you really mean is <strong>"your"</strong>...</p>
                    <p>*Sigh*... Anyways the onwnership of plans is irrevelent, all that matters is that progress is made, and this report gets sent out.</p>

                <div class="dialogue-text scientist">
                    <p>Speaking of which...</p>

                    <p>Despite initial setbacks including the mental breakdown of our finest soldier, several tasks were successfully completed:</p>

                    <p>- Implemented a functioning level loader<br>
                    - Added a Smash Bros–style platform effect<br>
                    - Resolved a bug where items were being picked up twice</p>

                    <p>We concluded that the double pickup issue was caused by two colliders detecting items simultaneously. The solution was to move one collider into a child object named <code>PickupTrigger</code> to isolate responsibility.</p>

                    <p>God it would be nice if I could isolate my midterm stress into a child object so it wouldn't effect every one of my components :(</p>

                    <p>We agreed my enhancements would solely be for combat!</p>

                <div class="dialogue-text scientist">
                    <p>Sorry, sometimes I get distracted by my fantasies...</p>
                    <p>Speaking of distractions, by comparing "our" plan with the progress report, it's unhideable "we" only managed to complete some of our tasks.</p>
                    <p>Pearl would you like to explain what happened?</p>
                </div>

                <div class="dialogue-text pearl">
                    <p>Honestly... That bug was just driving us crazy... And sometimes it's hard to move on with a task lists when you have this nagging problem in the back of your mind...</p>
                    <p>And I think it's okay to get distracted sometimes...</p>
                    <p>Because even though we didn't get everything on the list done, and even if we don't have anything flashy to present, we still managed to push through the mental barriers holding us back.</p>

                <div class="dialogue-text scientist">
                <p>Also Fixing that bug taught us something real about structuring entities and using child objects to isolate their components from eachother. So despite our shortcomings, tangible progress was made and with this the cause grows. It's like I always tell you pearl, "Intellectual growth is the catalyst for fear in our adversaries..."</p>
                <p>So remind yourself, even if there is no tangible feature attached to it, learning something is always beneficial!</p>

                <div class="dialogue-text pearl">
                    <p>That makes sense, and I do agree that learning something is always beneficial, but sometimes I feel like I'm stuck at a crossroad.</p>
                    <p>And I wish there was some way of telling which path will lead to more benefit. How should I spend my time...</p>
                    <p>Honestly it's a question that keeps me frozen... Sometimes I tell people I am "decision disabled"</p>

                <p> You're telling me...</p>
                <p>Today I wanted to create platforms  that you could jump up through but that could still be stood on, just like in the hit game Super Smash Bros. So I dug around the burrownet, and everyone said: “Use a Platform Effector 2D, and switch your Composite Collider from outlines to polygons.”</p>

                <p>Excellent. It works. But also: <em>why?</em> What is the Platform Effector doing? Why does polygon geometry matter? What forces govern this?</p>
                <p>How could I possible live with myself without knowing the answer?</p>

                    <p>Right... So as I was saying, this is where that fork in the road you were speaking of comes up.</p>
                    <p><strong>Path A:</strong> I Accept the magic (or TMB...). Move on. Make more progress with the game.</p><p>
                    </p><p><strong>Path B:</strong> I Research everything, fall into documentation black holes, probably get lost on 50 tangents, somehow end up on the wikipedia page for the Alaskan Ptarmigan, and gain both knowledge and new questions.</p>

            <p>I just hate leaving little gaps in my understanding… but also I have to accept if I chase every question I'll never finish the game.</p>

            <p>For the record: I still do not know why the collider geometry must be polygons.</p>
